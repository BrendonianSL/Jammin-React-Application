# Jammin: A React Application

Jammin is a React Application created as part of my Web Development Certification and serves as my first dive into REACT.js as well as the combined use with JS, HTML, AND CSS. This application allows user to access spotify API and search songs, add them to a playlist, and create one for their use in spotify.


## ðŸš€ About Me
I'm a recent college graduate with a degree in Media Arts & Science currently shifting careers from Game Development to Web Design. Any and all feedback is appreciated on anything that I create as improvement is a never-ending journey.


## Directions For Project Use
Unforuantely due to security risk, I cannot deploy this website to the web with my information included. But the project still runs on your computer locally with the following steps:

1: Ensure the localhost:3000 port is open for use. This is because my API redirects you to this port after authorization.

2: Create a Spotify API Account at https://developer.spotify.com

3: Create An App And Grab Your ClientID and ClientSecret from the page. DO NOT SHARE THESE WITH ANYONE.

4: In my project, access AuthenticationKey.js and set clientID to your personal ClientID. Do the same for clientSecret.

5: Install Node if you haven't already. Navigate to the application folder (which should just be the root folder you download from this project) and use the command "npm start" to run the application

6: Enjoy as you can now search the top 10 songs from the serach query and create a playlist!

## FAQ

#### Question 1

Will This Page Become Styled In The Future?

Yes. For now, I wanted to pump this out with functionality over form. Getting the project to work and displaying my understanding was more important to me than styling when developing. In the future I will come back to style and make this page look better!
